## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).

## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_analyze}

{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} events contain fields that describe the action that occurred. Values in the `requestData` and `responseData` fields are specific to {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_notm}}, and the other fields are common to all {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} events. For a more information about common fields, see [Event fields](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-event).

When a user opens, configures, or closes a {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} session, the event that is triggered has an `action` field set to `cloudshell.server.create`, `cloudshell.server.configure`, or `cloudshell.server.delete`. The event includes the following fields:

- The `initiator.name` field includes information about the user who interacted with the session.
- The `initiator.id` field shows the IBMid of the user who interacted with the session.
- The `target.id` field includes the Cloud Resource Name (CRN) of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} account and server where the session was modified, in the format `crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloudshell:<REGION>:a/<ACCOUNT_ID>:<CLOUD_SHELL_SERVER_ID>::`

When a session is successfully opened, configured, or closed, the corresponding event that is generated has an `outcome` that is set to `success` with a 200 `reason.reasonCode`. Otherwise, the event has an `outcome` of `failure` with the appropriate HTTP status code in `reason.reasonCode`, and the `responseData` field contains details about the error.

When an account owner or {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} administrator updates the {{site.data.keyword.cloud-shell_short}} settings, the event that is triggered has an `action` field set to `cloudshell.account-settings.update`.
